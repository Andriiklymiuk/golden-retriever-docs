## FAQ

**Q: Where are my collections stored?**  
A: Collections are stored as JSON files in the `collections` folder of your workspace. This allows them to be version controlled with your project.

**Q: Can I import Postman collections?**  
A: Yes! Golden Retriever uses Postman/Newman compatible collection format. Just copy your Postman collection JSON into a file in your `collections` folder.

**Q: How do I share collections with my team?**  
A: Since collections are stored in your project repository, just commit and push the `collections` folder. Your team can pull the changes and immediately use them.

**Q: Are my environment variables secure?**  
A: Environment variables are stored in your local `.env` file, which should be added to `.gitignore` to keep sensitive data secure. The extension supports masking sensitive data in the UI.

**Q: Can I run multiple requests at once?**  
A: Yes! You can run an entire collection or all collections at once using the play button in the collections view.

**Q: Does it support request chaining or variables from responses?**  
A: Currently, this feature is not supported. However, you can use environment variables and test scripts to achieve similar functionality.

**Q: How do I change the collections folder location?**  
A: You can configure the collections path in VSCode settings:

1. Open Settings (Ctrl+,)
2. Search for "Golden Retriever"
3. Update the "Collections Path" setting
